# Part 1

> They had to be fast, for there were always others.

Just to be clear, both are still alive—provided Dad’s not drunk enough to have fallen asleep on the street somewhere and frozen, and Mum’s not getting a heart attack from it, which has happened before. Considering the pleasant spring all over our northern hemisphere, I guess fatality is unlikely, so all good!

Last week I saw tons of private messages from Mum, which was unusual. For context, I barely message my parents and we never call each other (which I think is for the best). The three of us do have a group chat where they share gossip about who slept with whom at work, which managers just got arrested, what crazy assets turned up when the government raided their homes, and how much money they paid to the Regime to get released, but nothing more than that (Yes, my parents work at the same place, and no, it’s not a good idea).

I skimmed through Mum’s messages, no arrests, no scandals, boring, just Dad’s office politics mess, which has escalated to the point where my parents are considering a divorce because they really can’t reconcile their positions. Also, Dad has been drinking heavily, and at the tender age of fifty-something, decided to run away from home. Dad’s whereabouts are currently unknown, but I know if Mum actually wanted to find him, she would have succeeded.

I blocked Mum and the group chat for two years previously—this included the time I was working in Mexico—during which she (as she put it) sensed through “telepathic connection” that I had returned to China at some point. She “called some friends” and located all my immigration history, flight details, and possibly other travel records, which she was kind enough not to let me know about. She used to talk about this endeavour with great enthusiasm, often in front of others, to demonstrate how much she “loved me”. Considering she hasn’t done that to Dad, I guess the love between them really is gone—and to be fair, its shelf life had already far exceeded my expectations.

The messages involved tons of documents, chat records, and voice messages that bore an odd resemblance to a messy evidence bundle from an aggressive client, but since I happened to be working on a trial-summary exercise anyway, I figured I might as well treat it as practice. It was overwhelming at first, but after weeding out Mum’s emotional rambling, the case became quite clear:

The parties are, obviously, my parents, who went to university together and have been working at the same public hospital alongside many of their classmates since graduation. Growing up, I was immersed in over 30 years of gossip involving the same rotating cast of people. The stage is the largest public hospital locally (which, in a Chinese context, means it runs like a government organisation and the doctors are treated as civil servants). 

The parties are, obviously, my parents, who went to university together and have been working at the same public hospital alongside many of their classmates since graduation. Growing up, I was immersed in over 30 years of gossip involving the same rotating cast of people. The stage is the largest public hospital locally (which, in a Chinese context, means it runs like a government organisation and the doctors are treated as civil servants). 

The dispute is that the previous head of Dad’s department had retired, and the hospital organised a “democratic” vote to select a replacement. Dad won by an overwhelming majority, but management gave the position to another senior doctor with less experience—probably because his wife holds an important position in the local government.

After that senior doctor was promoted, he started trying to isolate Dad. Another department with the same specialisation saw this opportunity and invited Dad to join them. Dad wanted to go, but a senior hospital manager—the “Party Secretary”—refused to approve the paperwork.

Please don’t ask me what a Party Secretary is, because I don’t know (and gladly so). For me, it’s like a management position every public Chinese entity has. It’s like the head of the organisation, but affiliated more with the Party than with the actual organisation. A lot of Chinese people, including me, can’t seem to fathom whether the head or the Party Secretary is supposed to be an organisation’s “number one,” and I believe this lack of understanding has cost a lot of people dearly. I’ve wisely positioned myself where I don’t have to understand that question too well (and proudly so).

In Dad’s case, the Party Secretary is refusing to approve the transfer—even though everyone of actual relevancy (i.e., the ones with titles that you understand) to the hospital’s operations has approved. Our suspicion is that instead of treating the Party Secretary as number one, Mum and Dad treated her as number three or four, and didn’t offer any bribes, which is usually expected in these situations.

Mum was furious and reported the matter to the local government. Dad disagreed with this approach, since he only wanted to quietly land in the other department like a snowflake, without creating too much of a bang.

Later, he became reluctant to leave at all, because during this drama, the department was reorganised into three sub-teams—led by the new head, Dad, and another senior doctor. Each sub-team needs at least three doctors to be operational, but the new head was unable to get enough doctors onto his team, as most doctors wanted to be on Dad’s team—he’s the best at complex operations and the only one willing to train juniors.

The new head tried to threaten the junior working most closely with Dad (let’s call him Dr. Daddy’s Boy) into switching teams, but failed. Dad didn’t want his juniors and trainees to be bullied after his departure, so, as the knight with the shining armour (or the expendable soldier with no armour) he stepped down from the sub-team leader position and backed one of his juniors to become the new leader, placing Dr. Daddy’s Boy under his wings.

As such, Dad has given away his position in his current department, but couldn’t transfer to the new one either due to the Party Secretary’s disapproval.

Confusingly, he no longer seemed that keen on leaving. He wanted to stay and make sure this new team made up of his juniors could function smoothly after his potential departure. To make that happen, he’s been sabotaging Mum’s report, making contradictory remarks in the follow-up investigations and putting her in an awkward position. It didn’t help that many of the managers in both the hospital and the relevant government departments are their old friends from university. As Mum put it, since she can’t change the fact that Dad’s her partner in crime in producing me—divorce or not—she refused to back down, because she didn’t want to “lose face”.

This really isn’t a complicated situation. Given the variables, the outcome was always going to be as straightforward as a linear function or a basic simulation. Still, I found it a decent glimpse into the lives of ordinary Chinese people spawned at specific space-time coordinates. 

This glimpse will largely focus on domestic matters. I usually avoid investing energy in them—after years of mental health struggles associated with them, I have (quite successfully) programmed myself to stay numb and ignore relevant inputs.

However, over the past few years, I’ve noticed that even simple simulations can be hard to illustrate—for human beings, even those with the same character origin story but different spawning stats, often struggle to understand each other. Since I happen to have good data for visualising a kind of life that isn’t supposed to be seen, I would like to keep this record, and hopefully one day, some AI might make sense of it all.

So I wanted to write things down—before my robotic brain carries out its scheduled data purge.

This content will probably be very boring to most. If you happened to stumble across it, feel free to read it as fiction rather than non-fiction—for real lives are no more planned than fictional ones. If our parents know each other, I guess there’s a reason we’ve stayed friends for this long, and I’d really appreciate it if you could please pretend you didn’t see this, for none of my rambling would be new to you anyway.

 I grew up in a northern Chinese city. It’s in the province surrounding Beijing, but not Beijing. A friend from Beijing once summed up my hometown as the “Sin City” of China. As you will see later, this is somewhat accurate, but a more accurate description should be the “Beijing’s masturbation cup”— credit to some random netizen. However, the discourse around the intercourse between Beijing and its neighbours, and the disposal of the capital’s bodily fluid shall not be the topic of this essay.

My hometown is not a shithole per se, but many would agree it’s shitty. If you search the city’s name on YouTube in Mandarin, every result is about a few girls getting publicly beaten up by hooligans for refusing their advances. When I last visited home, this incident was a hot topic at dinner tables, for people were excited that we “went viral”. Most were very interested in whether the girls worked at nightclubs, and if so, which one. No one seemed to care much about the actual beating. People here are very used to incidents, but not to going viral, because news can’t really get out of this town, and probing eyes can’t get in.

Visually, it used to be very grim. The economy was heavily dependent on mining and steel production. It was once one of the most polluted cities in China, with winters that reminded me of Oliver Twist. People often say that if you ranked global steel production, China would come first, my hometown would come second, and my hometown’s illegal overproduction would come third. I’m not sure if that was ever true. It certainly isn’t now, for China has spent the past decade introducing production cuts and cracking down on pollution.

There used to be a lot of rich mine and steel bosses around, on Chinese New Year Eve (Or Lunar New Year, if you so prefer, but the narratives here are about China so I will use Chinese New Year through out), some of them would hire people to set off fireworks all night. It was really a sight. Mum was always busy on those nights, for she’s an ophthalmologist, and had to remove several eyeballs each new year because of defective fireworks or reckless people. She became lifelong friends with many of her patients this way, since she really was a master tailor when it came to stitching people’s faces back together.

When she was a junior, she trained in Beijing in plastic surgery and saw some of China’s earliest gender reassignment surgeries. These days, she still occasionally performs double eyelid procedures. It’s a one-cut surgery to transform Asian monolids into double lids, mostly for high schoolers applying to performing arts colleges who (or whose parents) believe bigger eyes will give them a better shot.

I’m glad she never randomly performed this or any procedure on me, though she had plenty of chances. In fact, my first ear piercings were the work of one of her anaesthesiologist colleagues. I was under general anaesthesia for a wisdom tooth extraction. I didn’t need general anaesthesia, but Mum arranged it without telling me because she thought I couldn’t handle the pain. The anaesthesiologist noticed I didn’t have any piercings and decided, on the spot, to pierce my ears with a medical syringe. She botched the angle—I had to wait for it to heal and get it redone later.

Back to Mum’s eyeballs. Some of them belonged to the steel bosses. Others, to scrap collectors. Those big firework displays usually came in cardboard boxes packed with a dozen or so shots each. You only had to light them once—they’d fire off one by one in a preset sequence. People who couldn’t afford to enjoy the holiday would rush in to grab the leftover cardboard boxes to sell. They had to be fast, for there were always others.

As a result, when a box of fireworks started to quiet down, many would take the gamble, assuming the last shot had already gone off. Some got lucky. Others not.

Mum doesn’t have to worry about that anymore. Fireworks are now banned too, as part of the effort to curb pollution. These days, my hometown looks quite green—even touristy. Many who’ve visited have commended it for how “liveable” it is. I suppose the steel bosses would agree, if they are still around.

It has a population of more than 7 million; I guess the metropolitan area holds around 4 million. It’s a small big city that once received the title of “National Civilised City” (全国文明城市)—one of 290 across the country. The award was later rescinded after the viral beating incident. I find “civilised” harder to explain than “Party Secretary”, so I will just leave it to your interpretation. It’s an engineered concept anyway.

The vast majority of the doctors at my parents’ hospital went to the same university. I grew up around stories about how a waitress in the hospital canteen got promoted to a management role after an affair with the hospital head, or about two gangs arriving at the hospital at the same time after a fight, both brandishing knives at the doctors, trying to make sure their friend get stitched back to one piece first (that was when I was daycare age, unlikely to happen now). As someone working in the legal profession, I’m glad this dilemma does not apply to lawyers, for my townspeople might die if there are no doctors treating them, but they will do just fine without advice on the rule of law.

Mum is local to my hometown, but Dad came from a (relatively) faraway province in central China. I guess his childhood smelled of buns and noodles, but not rice, for the climate there was so arid that only wheat could grow. When he was younger, it took hours for him to walk to school, and he had to get up really early. On his daily march to school, Dad had to break through a series of checkpoints—one of the most dangerous being a house where the owner kept two guard dogs roaming free at night. Since Dad always set out before dawn, he’d run into them every time. His tactic was to throw two buns as decoys, then seize the chance to break through while the enemy was distracted.

As a result, he got pretty athletic and at one point trained to be a football player. When he got to high school and started playing in the provincial league, he realised that with the inadequate training in his small town, there was no catching up to kids who had been coached properly since childhood. I learned about this story as he tried to convince me to give up any interest in music or art—because, like him, I’d obviously missed the window early on.

He didn’t apply to the university he and Mum attended in my hometown—in fact, he probably didn’t apply to any medical programme at all. Back then, people’s lives were mostly random (I guess they still are). My parents were born in the 1970s and their education, their parents’ mental health, and in turn, their own, were all disrupted by the Cultural Revolution—a decade of chaos in China (topic of another day). Two of my grandparents died before I was born, largely due to the toll they’ve taken from this mad period. Two survived, but hardly cared about my existence. My parents would bring up how this decade of madness traumatised their parents, but don’t seem to acknowledge the impact it had on themselves, so the above is just my own reasoning.

For my parent’s generation, it was insanely hard to get into university, and it wasn’t uncommon to get assigned somewhere randomly if your national exam marks weren’t high enough. Dad’s marks weren’t particularly high, his maths were very good, but for the English paper, he answered entirely by guessing. It was multiple choice, and defying the laws of probability, he got an impressive result of 40%. I’d say if he put in a little bit of work he would have nailed the first stage of the Solicitor Qualifying Exam of England and Wales, which has a pass mark just above 50%. I remember when I was nine and had just started to have English classes at school, I had homework that required parents to quiz us on spelling basic words—apples, bananas, that kind of thing. He already couldn’t help. Lucky me.

He originally applied for military school with all his mates, and attending military school meant a secured future within the Regime. One of his mates (let’s call him Army Boy) was very well connected. He got in without sitting the national exam. It was hard to gauge people’s background at that time; even Xi was just a nondescript lad from a neighbouring village in the same poor province. 

Army Boy told Dad that his dad, Army Boy Sr., had greenlighted that if his mates wanted to attend military school with him, they only needed to ask. Army Boy didn’t know Dad’s national exam results, and when the results released, Dad indeed at one point found himself pacing back and forth outside Army Boy’s house. 

He did not knock on that door. He had always been the top dog of the pack, and Army Boy was a sidekick at most. It just hurt Dad’s ego too much to ask for favours, and he never contacted Army Boy again.

Mum’s national exam results were slightly better (I guess). She had always wanted to be a police officer. Her results were good enough to get into that Beijing-based university affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security. She passed all rounds of interviews and would have had “connections” to look after her once she got in. However, my grandma was in poor health and wanted her youngest daughter to be a doctor (her eldest was already a dentist, and second eldest a police officer, I guess that wasn’t handy enough for her). So Mum signed up for the local medical school instead.

That didn’t go as planned, for my grandma passed away the first year Mum started working.

In hindsight, military school and police school would have been the perfect match for my parents. Dad was guileless, loyal to his pack, obedient; Mum was fierce, relentless, investigative. I often felt that if Mum had applied the same tactics tracking a criminal as she did tracking me, and used the same colourful language on a suspect as she later used on me, she would have solved any cold case and sent any suspect to their knees crying for their mama.

Anyway, at medical school, Mum met Dad, who had ended up there from a thousand miles away probably by random allocation. Their first encounter was in the canteen. Dad tried rice for the first time in his life, immediately dumped the entire plate, and loudly complained about the university’s audacity to feed *kibble* to humans. He got a lot of attention. Everyone assumed he must have been filthy rich to show such disdain for rice—when in fact, he’d just never eaten it before.

At university, Dad was the head of class; Mum, the head of sports. I never quite understood how Mum landed that position. I remember her saying she’d been practising martial arts since she was very young, and that when she was in primary school, she used to beat up boys and force them to carry her home on their backs. I’m still sceptical about the truthfulness of this—I just don’t see how the boys could have been willing. I would’ve fought her to the death if she’d tried that on me.

Even at university, Dad showed great spirit for self-sacrifice. Once, he and his bros got into some kind of argument with the class next door after a few drinks, and everyone gathered for a Gangs of New York-style fight. Dad didn’t want his bros to get into trouble, and persuaded everyone to leave. Just as people thought he’d calmed things down, he quietly sneaked out of the dorm without anyone noticing and smashed the window of the other class’s dorm with a heavy brick. No one knew what to make of it, and people went to Mum, demanding an explanation. Mum told me she didn’t understand him, and I guess she probably didn’t try to. My very existence is good proof.

Sometimes I wonder if any of the people currently handling Dad’s transfer paperwork were there at the dorm that day. It’s not entirely unlikely.

I don’t consider either of my parents acceptable dating options, and they are definitely not “compatible”. Anyway, they got married and were assigned to the same hospital. They belonged to the last generation of Chinese university graduates to receive assigned jobs. Dad was supposed to get assigned back to his hometown, but some of the people in power were my maternal grandparent’s friends or students. I suppose they helped, and Dad managed to stay (My grandparents were interesting characters in their own right, especially my grandpa. He went to a very good university, graduated with a perfect GPA and was an expert in crop breeding. Like many others of his generation, he answered Chairman Mao’s call that “educated youth must go to the countryside and to receive re-education from the poor, lower and middle peasants” and worked as a secondary school biology teacher). 

Anyway, Mum and Dad got married. Soon after settling down, they produced an extraordinary creature (cue narcissistic wink).

 They had no luck finding decent nannies and no help from their own parents. When I was around four or five, my paternal grandma visited for a few weeks, taking me to parks like walking a puppy. One day, she told me she’d be leaving tomorrow. I got up the next morning, saw her, and asked, “Why are you still here?” (Based on her later overreaction, I might have said, How the hell are you still here?—but surely a five-year-old wouldn’t say that. Right?) In hindsight, my social awkwardness clearly had deep roots. I realised immediately that it wasn’t the right thing to say, but genuinely didn’t know how to fix the situation. She got offended and said, “I *am* leaving. I won’t see you anymore. I’m going to play with the kids back home.” She did leave. That was the last time I saw her, and she is, incidentally, also still alive.

As a result, raising me was a huge task. Things got worse in 2003, when SARS—the Covid before Covid-19—broke out. Doctors were drafted to work in the designated SARS quarantine hospital, and families were only allowed to visit by peeking through the bars into the hospital grounds. Normally, married doctors with kids were drafted last, but I guess Dad volunteered.

Daycares were closed during SARS, and Mum really struggled to juggle childcare with a full-time medical job. Lucky for her, I had this classmate from daycare (let’s call him Boy Kun or BK, for he’s also a Kun); his grandma heard about our situation and kindly offered to take care of me. As a result, I started spending my entire days at BK’s grandma’s place playing with BK. I didn’t enjoy it at all—BK was stronger and would bully me. He particularly enjoyed tricking me onto a seesaw. He’d start playing normally at first, then after realising he weighed more, he’d jump up and down violently, smashing me on the metal seesaw and enjoying my inability to get off.

BK’s parents were business owners. After work, they’d come to the grandma’s place for dinner. In my opinion, BK’s parents’ parenting workload was child’s play. Unlike my parents, they outsourced everything to the grandma. All they seemed to do was give him a good spanking after I cried and complained about his bullying. Mum was really sorry that I brought this upon BK, but BK seemed to be Captain China material—he could do this all day and just resume bullying me the next morning, so I guess it didn’t really trouble him.

Sometimes I thought he was stupid, but he really wasn’t. He never did it when adults were watching.

I’m still friends with BK today. He’s doing a pure math PhD in the US. Quite a nice character. At one point in my life, I really didn’t want to be his friend anymore—not after what he did to me—but then I realised BK doesn’t even remember any of our daycare classmates (except those who later went to school with him), so he probably doesn’t remember how he “played” with me either. There’s no point in holding a grudge that meant nothing to the person who caused it.

I really wish my parents had just left me alone at home. I would’ve done just fine. Even in daycare, I was already a master at Red Alert 2 and Heroes of Might and Magic III. I didn’t know how it worked, as I probably couldn’t read most of the characters on the interface, but I picked up everything by watching Dad play. I’ve always thought of Windows 98 as my special twin brother—we’re the same age, but he’s much more special. Definitely a better sibling than BK.

Luckily, I got my chance after I started primary school. Mum and Dad were now comfortable leaving me at home during school holidays. They would come back during their lunch break to prepare a hot lunch for me. I always pretended to be asleep as they left for work, then immediately jumped on the computer, and shut it down a few minutes before their return so it could cool down as if no one touched it. I wonder what they thought I was doing to entertain myself while they were gone. Barbie?

When I was eight or nine, I stumbled upon adult content online. After concluding that the human body wasn’t all that interesting, I blocked all the sites via some parental control portal so that Dad wouldn’t inadvertently come across these sites that I felt would harm his mental and physical health. When I was around eleven, I started noticing China’s Great Firewall being deployed (interestingly, it’s also a baby of 1998). I started to “jump the wall,” but didn’t find anything particularly depressing that I wasn’t already aware of. Back then, average Chinese people weren’t yet brainwashed by algorithms, and anything sensitive had already been passed down by shared memory and discussed openly. Every major topic that people assume an average Chinese wouldn’t know, everyone around me knew, and naturally so did I. I also tried to register for Facebook and got the notification that I was underage. There really weren’t a lot to see on the other side.

After much exploration, I felt gaming was still the way to go (unfortunately, this isn’t one of those stories where the main character taught themselves to code and became a hacking prodigy)—and, much to Mum’s disappointment, I naturally became the first and so far the only person in the extended family to need prescription glasses.

# Part 2

My childhood was largely carefree until I was around eleven or twelve. By then, both my parents had become overworked senior doctors, especially Dad. I don’t think Dad ever had a proper weekend off; he was always up by 6:30 to do his ward rounds. He specialises in a field where patients are often in very serious condition—and sometimes, they don’t make it. His own father died from a disease he specialised in, during the first year he qualified. A grandpa I’d never met. I heard he’s quite sensible. Good to know.

When a patient dies, it’s not uncommon for furious relatives to break into the hospital and host a funeral in the lobby or the hospital head’s office. Sometimes they do have good reason to be angry, and Dad was caught in several such occasions.

One time, He got a last-minute call from a colleague who was unwell and asked him to cover a night shift. Dad agreed—he always does. The colleague had operated on a patient earlier that day. During the night shift, the patient suddenly deteriorated. Dad hadn’t been properly briefed on the patient’s condition other than being told that the surgery had gone well. He called the colleague, no answer. The patient passed away that night.

This is the version a 11-year-old me learned from my parents’ calls. I later stumbled across an article online written by the patient’s son. In this version, Dad was clearly negligent. He didn’t know what to do, and didn’t make much of an attempt. He insisted that nothing could be done before he heard back from the colleague, even as the patient’s sons and daughters knelt before him, begging him to save their father. He was passive, so passive that it was cruel.

Several similar incidents happened over a few months, maybe a year. It’s funny how the first time I heard the term “medical negligence”, I had already started graduate school. Growing up, words like *tort* and *settlement* all sounded foreign to me. The phrase that felt more familiar was *taking the blame*, and it was almost always associated with Dad. Nevertheless, Mum took on the role of Dad’s defence lawyer and firmly believed that he had been set up by irresponsible colleagues. Unfortunately, an 11-year-old me couldn’t be the judge—just as a 26-year-old me still can’t deliver a verdict. I guess it doesn’t matter now, for liabilities can be discharged, but blames cannot be untaken.

That said, I was a witness of the aftermath. I remember reading a message Mum sent to the then-not-yet-jailed hospital head, threatening to take “any measure necessary”, including reporting the head’s unrelated misconducts to stop Dad from getting dragged into these situations again. 

Dad’s solution was different: he started visiting temples. Many Chinese people frequent temples—whether Buddhist, Taoist, or folk religious sites. Even those who aren’t particularly religious often still customarily pray for more money or a promotion. I’ve never prayed for money or promotion, but I, too, couldn’t resist making wishes to Buddha. Interestingly, every single one of those wishes has come true (with the exception of world peace, though I knew that one was a bit too ambitious). None of them came true in the way I had hoped. I suppose I wasn’t specific enough—need to work on those legal drafting skills.

Dad used to visit these temples with us, but he was only interested in the hiking, not the praying. His closest encounter with religion was when he treated a Tibetan guru who had contracted parasites from eating Tibetan air-dried beef. He later used it as an example to argue that not all Buddhists are vegetarian. I guess the tragedies came so close together that Dad eventually decided to give praying a go. The incidents soon stopped. They never resumed. I don’t know what worked—Mum, Buddha, or maybe Dad just got better. 

Still, Dad needed ways to escape. Like many others, he turned to alcohol. He already enjoyed drinking, and had always been quite the comedian when drunk. His most iconic act was mistaking his bedroom for the toilet. On several occasions, I heard him walk into his bedroom, announce to himself with great satisfaction, “Finally! Toilet!” and then proceed to relieve himself. 

I tried to convince myself I must have misheard, but the sound effects were far too realistic, and the purest form of happiness—that of a drunk man—can warm even the most cynical heart. Thank God it was always number one, because number two, even for a drunk man, would have been considerably harder to accomplish in a bedroom. He used to deny this, until one day I left some newspaper on the floor and thereby preserved crucial evidence. 

When he’s drunk he’s a man of few words, and every single one of my primary school classmates would soon find out.

It was Year 5. One day, I got into trouble with the head teacher of my class, who refused to release us for our afternoon break because she wanted to go over some practice questions that we’d already done a thousand times, just another average day in the life of a Chinese student. I suppose it’s time to take a short detour and show you how 12 years of such lengthy days could fly by.

At primary school (Year 1-6), we prepare for the **Primary-to-Secondary exam**; good marks could secure us a place in a “fast” class at secondary school. It’s quite common for schools to divide students into “fast” and “ordinary” classes. Some schools can be very creative with the naming—“Rocket Class” is a very popular one, and I associate it more with fast burnout rather than just “fast”.

“Fast” classes come with great perks: stricter teachers, more dumb homework, excessive exam prep, and everyone’s favourite—more competitive classmates. It’s the kind of situation that makes you wish you were “ordinary”. Some schools would reshuffle the classes based on exam rankings; once you drop below a certain rank, be prepared to bid farewell to your mates and join a slower class.

In secondary school (Year 7-9) we prepare for the **City Exam**, where we compete with others from the same city for a place (in a fast class) at a good high school. In our small big town (of more than 7 million people), there is only one good high school, so if you have a childhood crush who is somewhat smart, this is the opportunity to rekindle the flame.

High school (Year 10-12) is all about preparing for the **Gaokao**, where we compete with other poor souls in the same province for a spot at university. This exam is so important that I’ll refer to it as the **One Shot**. This is not technically accurate, as you can take the One Shot as many times as you like, provided you're fine with staying in Year 12 forever. Still, for most people, the One Shot remains to be the only known chance to avoid becoming their parents’ retirement plan. So, the One Shot it is.

When it comes to university admissions, each university assigns a different quota to each province, typically reserving a larger share for their home province*. Admissions are, in theory, strictly based on our One Shot rankings (after adding extra marks from a few qualifying schemes), and nothing else. 

```
*However, if the students from a certain province happen to be particularly attached to their hometown, a larger quota does not necessarily mean less competition.
```

Chinese universities are divided into tiers, which, based on my observation, are widely used as filters in recruiters’ CV screenings. My province, the only one in the country with no top-tier university, receives a pitifully small share of the quota for top-tier admissions. We start the game on hard mode, with every teacher reminding us that a single mark can shift our rank by thousands of places in the One Shot.

I used to assume that students from nearby Beijing had it easier, since many top-tier universities were located locally and the admission quotas were more favourable. For context, in 2024, among all provinces, my province had one of the lowest admission rate to the “Chinese Oxbridge” (Peking and Tsinghua University, both based in Beijing), at 0.05% (330 out of 670k), while Beijing had the highest, at 0.86% (580 out of 67k)*. I realised my assumption had been wrong when I came across some Beijing parents’ prep material for their kid’s Daycare-to-Primary School assessment day. I suppose not all Beijing kids are on easy mode after all.

```
*All figures are approximate and based on publicly available data.
```

My primary school teacher made sure we were aware of rankings from a young age. She used to instruct us to write down in our diaries the names of classmates we saw as our “rivals”, as a reminder that we were meant to outrank them in the next exam. Writing down someone’s name in my diary felt too intimate, and listing multiple rotating candidates just felt absurd. So I didn’t bother.

I never quite appreciated my primary school teachers’ efforts—whether it was going over stupid homework or delivering emotional speeches about the importance of exams. Unlike university, we didn’t have laptops or phones, and the only way to escape from a boring class was to physically leave it. I made myself a minor celebrity among teachers and students alike by walking out of class whenever I felt a teacher’s monologue wasn’t worth the ticket. I tried to make sure each strut was more dramatic than the last. Growing up, I often receive comments that I sometimes walk like I’m about to beat someone up. I guess that bad habit started there.

Eventually, I ran out of ideas to impress my audience and wanted to retire from these performances for good—so much so that one year later, on the day I was supposed to start secondary school, I announced to my parents that I didn’t want to go to school anymore and wanted to self-study.

Dad didn’t have much of a reaction. He complained to Mum “How the hell did you raise the fucking kid?(**鸡巴崽子怎么教育的？**)” and hurried to work.

Mum stayed, and managed to get me to go back to school after making it clear that she wouldn’t let me donate my organs before we could both end our pain once and for all.

Back to that dull afternoon in Year 5, as the teacher detained us from our much needed break, I figured a silent walkout wouldn’t cut it this time—I stood up, slammed my desk hard, and called out the teacher. I didn’t know why I acted that way, I suspect it had something to do with my first period looming and the hormones fluctuations starting to get to me.

That conveniently got all my classmates released for break, because I gave the teacher a minor heart attack—my parents later had to fit her with one of those ECG monitors. To her credit, she didn’t collapse. Instead, she seized me by the wrist, and we were locked in a silent tug of war stalemate. If this were a K-drama, that was probably the part where we should kiss. In the dead silence, I contemplated my future, and upon realising my next 7 years of education could only get worse, despair washed over. After looking around the room to make sure all my audience had left, I started to cry hysterically.

After the chaos I created, the teacher called my parents. Dad came to collect me. By the time he arrived, all audience had returned to the classroom, and the performance did not disappoint—In front of all 60 of them, Dad gave me two big slaps across my face and dragged me off the podium.

I don’t have a very clear memory of the event; it’s just one of my usual gigs, but years later, a friend told me the scene was such a sensory overload that it fried her young nervous system, for when Dad got in, he reeked of alcohol and slapped me without any hesitation or saying a single word.

Drinking wasn’t Dad’s only form of escape. He started an affair with a nurse in her 20s. By the time we found out, I had already been suspicious for a while due to his absences during Mum’s night shifts. I didn’t do anything about it, for I quite enjoyed having the apartment to myself.

Even at a young age, I had very low expectations of people, and in doing so, rarely experienced the harsh sting of disappointment. What did puzzle me was how anyone could possibly want to sleep with Dad, who was, objectively speaking, nowhere near attractive and further from wealthy. That was when I realised cheating has absolutely nothing to do with attractiveness or desirability. It’s about values—whether someone thinks cheating is acceptable. Even the most undesirable individuals can, and often do, pay for sex if needed. It seems like a lot of people are completely fine with keeping up the act with their partners while getting something else on the side. Makes me wonder why they still bother with TV dramas, when they themselves are already such good actors in real life.

Dad said he thought the girl was marriage material, and that since his relationship with Mum wasn’t close anymore and I wasn’t talking to him much, he felt depressed. 

That was funny. What exactly am I supposed to talk to him about—alcohol? Alcohol does get people to talk, but I wasn’t drinking then (and still don’t). The only topics I ever wanted to discuss with my parents were workplace gossip and local politics. After their work started to involve deaths, those topics were off the table.

I thought Dad’s situation was one of paying for sex. We later found out that the girl had been sleeping with a bunch of people during night shifts—so much so that some doctors refused to work with her (so I guess there’s still hope for humanity after all?). I doubt she loved Dad—she probably just needed some nice dinners. Mum investigated her and found out she was engaged. She then investigated the fiancé and called him, only to discover he still wanted to marry her. 

Mum originally didn’t want anyone at work to know, for no one wants all their university friends to know their spouse cheated. Unfortunately, one colleague overheard the girl on a crowded bus, saying, “I slept with a doctor in my department named [Dad’s full name]. His wife just found out. What do I do?” Her friend apparently advised her to get some money out of it.

Mum was furious that this girl would dare to air her dirty laundry on a bus. She marched straight into Dad’s department to beat her up. The head of the nurses—whose son went to school with me in the year above—tried to intervene. Mum stopped speaking to her and never picked up her son with me again. 

Dad didn’t lose his job. Where I’m from, people don’t get reprimanded for these things; that’s how the system keeps functioning. He did make me feel gross, but that was just a thought I could block out if I didn’t engage with it. The girl, on the other hand, gave me a physical urge to vomit. The other nurses described her as “slow”, and I’m sure she’s not pretty, for a pretty girl that’s low and slow would have landed someone actually rich. 

I felt she violated the wholesome image of the female gender, and briefly considered removing such a discomfort from planet earth myself. After doing some research on Chinese criminal law, I was pleased to find that there was no criminal prosecution for children under 14, and I was around 12 or 13 at the time (apparently many children did the same research, and the age cut-off had been recently lowered to 12). After much deliberation, I abandoned the plan, for if her fiancé loved her that much, I might need to deal with him as well after her removal, and I just couldn’t be bothered wasting time on stupid people

I wish them happily ever after.

 Part 2

  My parents didn’t divorce, I guess they stayed together for the same old reason “for the kid”. I was in secondary school at the time. As I said, I only agreed to go because Mum threatened my organs would go to waste otherwise. This happened on the first day of class—but before that, we had this orientation week which involved a group bootcamp customary in every Chinese state school called the “military training”. This was essentially just boy/girl scout drills, where we marched in formation under the scorching sun; so let’s just rebrand it as the Scorch Scout (SS).

Although I had long planned not to go to school, I participated in the SS willingly and did not announce my plans until the SS was over. After all, I’d already patiently waited all summer—why not wait a few more days to witness the stupidity of school firsthand, just to prove I was right?

On the first day of SS, Mum asked me to wear a gaudy hair clip, since my then non-permanent 3:7 part was covering my eyes, and she thought that would make a bad impression. For context, my secondary school had a strict hair policy: every girl was required to have short, ear-length bob with straight bangs. The school’s reasoning was that long hair would take too much time to maintain and distract girls from their studies (*fair enough*), and distracted girls would distract boys (*seriously? Teenage boys could be distracted by anything!*). Straight bangs have been the archenemy of my life. I swore I would defend my 3:7 part no matter what. If that entailed taking on the headmaster with that horrible hair clip, so be it.

At the end of the first day of SS, my class head teacher called me into her office for a private conversation. She said:

“You’re here to study, not to seduce boys. I don’t want to see your hair clip tomorrow.”

“Okie!” I replied, though I felt the “seduce boys” inference was utterly unfounded. It was the first time in my life I didn’t argue back when I felt I was wronged. 

My internal script read “*Just another week and I’m out of here, bitch! (smiling, flipping and spitting)*”

Kun exits.

Kun enters.

Unfortunately, since I lost the argument about not going to school, I had to go—and was late on the first day of class. I sat at the last available desk, the one crammed against the broom and bin cupboard at the front of the classroom. Due to the awkward shape of the cupboard, the desk and chair were jammed so close together that only someone skinny could squeeze in. I got moved to a regular seat soon after, since the bin seat with reduced legroom actually cost extra—it was close to the podium, right under the teacher’s nose.

My secondary school ran a seating rotation system: every week, we had to move one row forward or sideways for a “fair opportunity” to sit closer to the teacher, but if someone’s parents were willing to pay our class head teacher the “seat selection fee”, they would be excluded from the rotation and secure that bin seat permanently. Naturally, I didn’t get to retain my first-class bin seat for free. We later nicknamed the teacher Pliers, for she really enjoyed pinching and bruising students. I was spared from this as I was too skinny to be squishy.

Though flying economy on a crowded flight captained by Pliers, who had disliked me since day one, I enjoyed school. After everything that happened, with my parents arguing and despising each other but not divorcing, home felt like a delayed train full of crying babies and screaming Karens. Imagine sitting on this train, would you try to calm your fellow passengers? Probably not, for you knew this would be a lost cause. When the nuisance was really getting to you, the Karens putting their stinky feet on your tray table, the babies pouring drinks on your newly polished boots and freshly pressed suit, would you try to fight it? Maybe yes, and then you would still lose and regret that you tried. It was poor luck that you ended up in this situation, and you must patiently wait for a good escape window to open up.

Secondary’s school’s dullness and repetitiveness was on a whole other level, but I stopped slamming desks and calling out teachers—I had realised this was a systematic issue and had nothing to do with any individual teacher. My protest turned silent: I simply stopped doing homework and was quite often barred from entering the classroom because of it. Pliers would sentence me to run laps around the schoolyard or sweep fallen leaves. To be fair, getting a bit of exercise wasn’t entirely bad, as I was scrawny and had always failed my physical assessments. Thanks to the daily exercise, I got full marks within a few months. The leaf sweeping was also oddly therapeutic. Sisyphean, almost. Especially in autumn, when I had to shovel up sodden leaves from several old sycamore trees. I heard these trees were later cut down because some boys tried running up the trunks to see how far they could go—another Sisyphean effort, I suppose.

Unfortunately, things weren’t so great once you considered that our city had terrible air quality (before Xi’s crackdown on pollution), and the track wasn’t rubber or turf, just bare dirt. Pliers had worse punishments for others. In addition to pinching, she enjoyed making students write “I must not…” lines like Dolores Umbridge. Without the bleeding magic ink, thankfully, but a hundred times over.

At secondary school there was a boy nicknamed Hair—supposedly for body hair, though he wasn’t particularly hairy, so I never figured out what kind. Let’s be cultured and call him Harry. Harry had a creepy way about him. He liked touching girls inappropriately and telling everyone whom he touched and how. He was wandering around me during SS and touched me a few times. I didn’t report him, as he gave off the vibe of someone who couldn’t care less about Pliers, his parents, or any consequences. I suppose People like him don’t necessarily cause damage; they just enjoy watching others taking offence. So I gave him nothing. I just looked at him in boredom, like watching a toddler throw a tantrum. He soon lost interest.

During SS, the school surprised us with an impromptu ranking exam. Harry placed second. I placed third or fourth. We both clearly ranked higher than the other had expected, and he completely left me alone after that.

Sometime in Year 8, the school decided every class should overhaul their seating plans by ditching the traditional rows-and-columns layout in favour of group clusters. Pliers enjoyed the exercise and placed Harry next to me again, along with a few other names from the naughty list. She did sprinkled my group with a couple of lovely girls, but immediately surrounding me—eight seats in total—were all boys.

This was a real disaster for me—our campus was very old and there were no toilets in the classroom buildings. To use the toilet, you had to trek across to the sports field, where a separate toilet building stood like an outpost. It’s quite a trek, and everybody needed a toilet comrade. For girls, this should be any girl in a neighbouring seat. Everyone knew that only losers went to the toilet alone. 

This was Year 8, when I was deeply committed to becoming a cool girl, and a cool girl does not walk past two desks just to ask someone’s hand for the loo. I decided I would go alone.

Pliers overheard me complaining about the new seating arrangement. She came over, smiling, and said, “sorry, I didn’t realise I placed no other girls around you.” 

I guess she figured out I wasn’t there to “seduce boys” after all. Took her long enough.

On one of those forlorn trips to the toilet, just as I was pulling my pants up and heading out, a girl from the year below stopped me. She introduced herself, said she found my hairstyle cool, and wanted to be friends.

I suppose if you’re looking to make new friends, the toilet is just as good a place as any. Some onlookers later described the scene as me receiving a **告白** (confession of love) in the loo.

I didn’t know her, but I knew of her. She was very pretty, with an even prettier voice. Let’s call her Gakki. In my humble opinion, she was the only girl in the entire school who ever truly pulled off that straight bangs hairstyle.

Gakki served as the host for all school events. The school administration seemed to have an uncanny knack for selecting the pretties girls for this sort of thing. Their process worked better than our informal student polls, though I never figured out how. It’s not like they had our headshots on file.

I had on-and-off chats with Gakki over the years, I learned that her parents later sent her to an international school in Israel, and then to the UK for university. A few months ago, she messaged me for advice. She apologised that that much of what she used to say about herself wasn’t true. Then she told me another version: Her father was a notorious figure locally, with ties on both sides of the law. Both she and her mother had long suffered from domestic violence. They never called the police, for her father was the kind of person who couldn’t be jailed—and if jailed, couldn’t be kept there.

She was severely depressed and was expelled from the international school. They were worried something might happen to her and didn’t want it to happen on their premises. She studied from home, signed up for A-level equivalents, but couldn’t complete it due to mental health issues and the difficulty of studying while living with her parents.

Eventually, she ran away. She had done all kinds of jobs “within the boundary of law”, managed to save some money, become mentally operational again, and wanted to see if there was a way to go abroad and possibly go to university.

None of this surprised me. While I didn’t know the details about her father, I could easily picture him. In our hometown, there are many others like him—usually operating in mining, fishing, steel, cement, real estate, private hospitals, or some flexible mix of the above. Her father just sounded like a stereotypical NPC that would spawn in our town. Tackling him would probably be a side quest, not part of the main story line. Truth be told, the whole town would likely sit in one of those fogged-out regions beyond the main map, which doesn’t render unless you fall off some cliff and land there by accident.

I visited my hometown over the holiday season last year. Gakki said she’d be in town too, so we arranged to meet and brainstorm her options. Later, she said she couldn’t make it because of work. I didn’t ask why. I just texted her that I wished her the best. She didn’t reply.

At the time we first spoke, I had no idea that Gakki was the kind of girl who fought.

She was just a pretty girl who smiled.
